# Cipher

# *INTRODUCTION :-* 


In today's digital age, we use a variety of online services that require us to create and remember numerous passwords. It is essential to create strong and unique passwords for each service to protect our online privacy and security. However, it can be challenging to remember all the passwords, especially if we have many accounts.To address this challenge, we propose a "Cipher" that can be use for Password Management System with Encryption-Decryption and File Handling. The system provides a user-friendly interface to manage and store passwords securely. The passwords are encrypted using a secure algorithm to ensure their security, and the system also includes backup and restore options to prevent data loss.The proposed system is developed in C programming language, using the OpenSSL library to implement the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption and decryption. The system also includes file handling features to import and export password data in CSV format.The Cipher will provide users with the ability to create, view, edit, and delete their passwords. The system will also include a search functionality to find specific passwords and a password strength checker to ensure secure passwords. 
In summary, the proposed Cipher will be a valuable tool for users who want to store their passwords securely and efficiently. The system will be tested for functionality, usability, and security, ensuring it is a reliable and secure tool for managing passwords.
