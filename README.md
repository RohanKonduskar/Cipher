# Cipher

# *INTRODUCTION :-* 

In today's digital age, we use a variety of online services that require us to create and remember numerous passwords. It is essential to create strong and unique passwords for each service to protect our online privacy and security. However, it can be challenging to remember all the passwords, especially if we have many accounts.To address this challenge, we propose a "Cipher" that can be use for Password Management System with Encryption-Decryption and File Handling. The system provides a user-friendly interface to manage and store passwords securely. The passwords are encrypted using a secure algorithm to ensure their security, and the system also includes backup and restore options to prevent data loss.The proposed system is developed in C programming language, using the OpenSSL library to implement the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for encryption and decryption. The system also includes file handling features to import and export password data in CSV format.The Cipher will provide users with the ability to create, view, edit, and delete their passwords. The system will also include a search functionality to find specific passwords and a password strength checker to ensure secure passwords. 
In summary, the proposed Cipher will be a valuable tool for users who want to store their passwords securely and efficiently. The system will be tested for functionality, usability, and security, ensuring it is a reliable and secure tool for managing passwords. 

# *OBJECTIVES :-*

The objective of a synopsis for a project on Password Management System with Encryption-Decryption and File Handling in C would be to provide an overview of the project's scope, goals, and methodology. 

The following are some potential objectives that could be included in a synopsis for this project: 

1.To develop a secure and efficient password management system using C      programming language that can store, retrieve and manage passwords for different user accounts.

2.To implement encryption and decryption algorithms to ensure the security of the       password database. 

3.To incorporate file handling techniques to store and retrieve password data in a file, allowing users to access their password information from anywhere. 

4.To create a user-friendly interface that allows users to add, delete, update, and retrieve passwords easily. 

5.To conduct rigorous testing to ensure the system's reliability and security, including stress testing and penetration testing. 

6.To document the development process and provide clear instructions for users on how to use the password management system. 

7.To adhere to best practices for secure programming, such as avoiding buffer overflow vulnerabilities and following secure coding guidelines. 


# *SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS :-*

1. Operating System Compatibility

The system should be compatible with major operating systems including Windows, macOS, and Linux. This ensures the software can be used by a wide range of users with different OS preferences.

2. C++ Compiler and Development Environment

A modern C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later standards, such as GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), Clang, or Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC). Additionally, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or CLion can be used to facilitate the development process.

3. Cryptographic Library

Incorporation of a robust cryptographic library such as OpenSSL, Crypto++, or libsodium to handle encryption and decryption tasks. This library must be properly installed and configured within the development environment.

4. File Handling Library

Utilization of standard C++ libraries for file handling (e.g., <fstream>, <iostream>, <filesystem>) to manage reading from and writing to files securely. Ensure that the filesystem library is available and supported on the chosen operating system.
